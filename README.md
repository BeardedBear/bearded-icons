# Bearded Icons

> [!NOTE]
> I'm looking for colour-blind developers to create specific variations for Bearded Theme! If you're interested, you can contact me by email at : beardedbearbear@gmail.com ! :)

> If an icon is missing, please create an issue ! :)

> I strongly recommend to set the `workbench.tree.indent` setting to `20` for better readability

> I created this icon pack to complete my vscode theme: [Bearded Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BeardedBear.beardedtheme)
